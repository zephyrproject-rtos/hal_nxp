NXP S32 HAL
###########

Origin:
   NXP Real-Time Drivers (RTD)
   https://www.nxp.com/design/automotive-software-and-tools/real-time-drivers-rtd:AUTOMOTIVE-RTD

Purpose:
   Provides device header files and bare metal peripheral drivers for NXP S32 SoCs.
   Zephyr shim drivers are built on top of these imported drivers to adapt the S32
   drivers APIs to Zephyr APIs.

Description:
   The "drivers" directory contains a sub-set of NXP S32 Real-Time Drivers used to enable
   Zephyr support on NXP S32 SoCs. The "soc" directory contains SoC-specific default
   configuration for these drivers, used at driver initialization time. The configuration
   was generated with NXP S32 Design Studio for S32 Platform.
   Care should be taken to retain local changes to the driver files that are documented
   in Patch List section of this document.

Dependencies:
   CMSIS header files
