/**
 * @brief     HSE SYS Authorization Request service.
 * @details
 *    During run-time, the User rights can be temporarily elevated to SuperUser(CUST/OEM) using HSE Authorization Request/Response.
 *    - CUST SuperUser rights are granted using an authorization key owned by CUST.
 *    - OEM SuperUser rights are granted using an authorization key owned by OEM.
 *    - The User rights (non privilege rights) can be requested without authorization.
 *      In this case, HSE_SYS_Authorization_Resp shall not be used.
 *
 * @note
 *    - After reset, the default access rights are used (see #hseSysRights_t).
 *    - If no authorization key is installed during CUST_DEL or OEM_PROD life cycle, the keys can be updated only having USER rights.
 *    - HSE FW can perform only one SYS Authorization Request at a time. A second request will overwrite the first request.
 *    - An authorization key is a NVM key that can only be used for verify.
 *    - If authorization succeeds, it will be opened on the MU Interface on which the request was performed,
 *      and the services that needs authorization  (e.g. key import/generate/derive/export) must be performed on the same MU Interface.
 *    - The system authorization procedure can be used to emulate the SHE CMD_DEBUG using the MASTER_ECU_KEY key (as per SHE specification).
 *      In this case, if SU access rights are requested for Key Management services (see #hseSysAuthOption_t),
 *      the authorization using MASTER_ECU_KEY cannot be performed if any SHE key has the WRITE_PROTECTED flag set. <br>
 *      Access rights requested only for NVM Configuration services (see #hseSysAuthOption_t) are not bound to this condition.
 *      Note that SHE keys can be erased only if the authorization was performed with the MASTER_ECU_KEY (refer to #hseEraseKeySrv_t).
