# MCX_SPC

## [2.10.0]

- New Features
  - Add feature macro to be compatible with some platforms where SPC does not support:
    1. Has no SC register SPC_LP_REQ bitfield.
    2. Has no SC register SPC_LP_MODE bitfield.
    3. Has no PD_STATUS register.
    4. Has no SRAMCTL register.

## [2.9.1]

- Improvements
  - There is no need to ensure that the bandgap is enabled before setting the active mode core LDO
    regulator drive strength and voltage level, because the hardware will automatically turn on the
    bandgap function if it is required by the hardware when configuring the LDO.

## [2.9.0]

- New Features
  - Add feature macro to be compatible with some platforms where SPC does not support overdrive voltage.

## [2.8.1]

- Improvements
  - Fixed cert_int31_c_violation of  SPC_GetVoltageDetectStatusFlag(), SPC_GetExternalDomainsStatus()
    and SPC_SetDCDCBurstConfig.

## [2.8.0]

- New Features
  - Updated MCX_SPC driver for compatibility with SoCs without PD_STATUS[PWR_REQ_STATUS].

## [2.7.0]

- New Features
  - Added new function to unretain RAM array.

## [2.6.0]

- Bug Fixes
  - The enumeration kSPC_DeepPowerDownWithSysClockOff should be 0x8U.
- New Features
  - Added functions to get the last low-power mode that the power domain requested.

## [2.5.0]

- Improvements
  - Updated SPC_SetLowPowerModeCoreLDORegulatorConfig() with adding check that LP_CFG[CORELDO_VDD_LVL]
    only be updated when CORELDO is in normal driver strength in active mode.
  - Updated SPC_SetLowPowerModeRegulatorsConfig() with adding check the if DCDC voltage level set as retention
    mode, CORELDO low voltage detection must be disabled.
  - Updated spc_analog_module_control with adding Opamp3 support.
- New Features
  - Added functions to mask/unmask voltage detections in active mode.

## [2.4.2]

- Improvements
  - Fixed the violation of MISRA C-2012 rules.

## [2.4.1]

- Improvements
  - Fixed the violation of MISRA C-2012 rules.

## [2.4.0]

- Improvements
  - Refined APIs to set regulators, the input parameters will be check firstly before setting register.
  - Improved APIs' document.
  - Removed software check for DCDC's settings since there is not hardware restrictions for DCDC.
  - Added new APIs to check if glitch detector is enabled in active/low power mode.
  - Added new APIs for DCDC burst feature, make it more flexible to use.
  - Added new API to enable/disable DCDC bleed resistor.
  - Set functions of VD_SYS_CFG[LVSEL] configuration as deprecated,
    since this bit filed is reserved for all devices.
  - Updated details of spc_core_ldo_voltage_level_t to align with description of latest RM,
    added comments to reminder users that the retention voltage is reserved in some devices.

## [2.3.0]

- New Features
  - Updated glitch detect API to support devices which do not have aGDET

## [2.2.1]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed an issue of SPC_SetActiveModeRegulatorsConfig() which will cause LVD in case of setting
    DCDC and CORE LDO into higher voltage level.

## [2.2.0]

- New Features
  - Added some macros to support some devices(such as MCXA family) do not equipped DCDC, SYS_LDO and so on.
  - Added new function SPC_EnableSRAMLdOLowPowerModeIREF(), SPC_TrimSRAMLdoRefVoltage(),
    SPC_EnableSRAMLdo() to support some devices(such as MCXA family) that support control of
    SRAM_LDO.
  - Fixed violation of MISRA C-2012 rule 17.7.
  - Fixed an issue in SPC_SetLowPowerModeRegulatorsConfig() function that set ACTIVE_CFG register by mistake.

## [2.1.0]

- Improvements
  - Added new functions to set regulators' voltage level and drive strength individually.
  - Updated SPC_SetActiveModeRegulatorsConfig() and SPC_SetLowPowerModeRegulatorsConfig()
    based on new added functions.

## [2.0.1]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed a bug that external burst not working properly.
  - Fixed a bug that is SPC has VDD_DS the voltage is not configured correctly.

## [2.0.0]

- Initial version.
