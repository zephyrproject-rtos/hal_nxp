    Set proper RX watermarks to reduce the ISR response times.

## [2.4.2]

- Improvements
  - Initialized the EDMA configuration structure in the LPSPI EDMA driver.
- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed bug that function LPSPI_MasterTransferBlocking should return after the transfer complete flag is set to
    make sure the PCS is re-asserted.

## [2.3.0]

- New Features
  - Supported the master configuration of sampling the input data using a delayed clock to improve slave setup time.

## [2.2.1]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed bug in LPSPI_SetPCSContinous when disabling PCS continous mode.

## [2.2.0]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed bug in 3-wire polling and interrupt transfer that the received data is not correct and the PCS continous
    mode is not working.

## [2.1.0]

- Improvements
  - Improved LPSPI_SlaveTransferHandleIRQ to fill up TX FIFO instead of write one data to TX register which improves
    the slave transmit performance.
  - Added new functional APIs LPSPI_SelectTransferPCS and LPSPI_SetPCSContinous to support changing PCS selection
    and PCS continous mode.
- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed bug in non-blocking and EDMA transfer APIs that kStatus_InvalidArgument is returned if user configures
    3-wire mode and full-duplex transfer at the same time, but transfer state is already set to kLPSPI_Busy by
    mistake causing following transfer can not start.
  - Fixed bug when LPSPI slave using EDMA way to transfer, tx should be masked when tx data is null, otherwise in
    3-wire mode which tx/rx use the same pin, the received data will be interfered.

## [2.0.5]

- Improvements
  - Added timeout mechanism when waiting certain states in transfer driver.
- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed the bug that LPSPI can not transfer large data using EDMA.
  - Fixed MISRA 17.7 issues.
  - Fixed variable overflow issue introduced by MISRA fix.
  - Fixed issue that rxFifoMaxBytes should be calculated according to transfer width rather
    than FIFO width.
  - Fixed issue that completion flag was not cleared after transfer completed.

## [2.0.4]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed in LPSPI_MasterTransferBlocking that master rxfifo may overflow in stall condition.
  - Eliminated IAR Pa082 warnings.
  - Fixed MISRA issues.
    - Fixed rules 10.1, 10.3, 10.4, 10.6, 11.9, 14.2, 14.4, 15.7, 17.7.

## [2.0.3]

- Bug Fixes
  - Removed LPSPI_Reset from LPSPI_MasterInit and LPSPI_SlaveInit, because this API
    may glitch the slave select line. If needed, call this function manually.

## [2.0.2]

- New Features
  - Added dummy data set up API to allow users to configure the dummy data to be transferred.
  - Enabled the 3-wire mode, SIN and SOUT pins can be configured as input/output pin.

## [2.0.1]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed the bug that the clock source should be divided by the PRESCALE setting in
    LPSPI_MasterSetDelayTimes function.
  - Fixed the bug that LPSPI_MasterTransferBlocking function would hang in some corner cases.
- Optimization
  - Added #ifndef/#endif to allow user to change the default TX value at compile time.

## [2.0.0]

- Initial version.
