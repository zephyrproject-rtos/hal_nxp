# EDMA (DMA3)

## [2.5.2]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed the EDMA header index retrieval error caused by done bit calculation mistake issue.

## [2.5.1]

- Bug Fixes
  - enables the auto stop request feature in API EDMA_ResetChannel

## [2.5.0]

- Improvements
  - Add API EDMA_GetTransferSize for EDMA_PrepareTransferConfig to reduce HIS CCM value.

## [2.4.0]

- Improvements
  - Added peripheral to peripheral support in DMA3 driver.
- Bug Fixes

## [2.3.2]

- Improvements
  - Conditionally compile interrupt handling code to solve the problem of using this driver on CPU cores that do not support interrupts.

## [2.3.1]

- Bug Fixes
  - Added clear TCD_CITER_ELINKNO and TCD_BITER_ELINKNO registers in EDMA_AbortTransfer to make sure the TCD registers in a correct state for next
    calling of EDMA_SubmitTransfer.

## [2.3.0]

- Improvements
  - Added feature FSL_FEATURE_EDMA_HAS_NO_SBR_ATTR_BIT to separate DMA without ATTR bitfield.

## [2.2.7]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed violations of MISRA C-2012 rule 10.8, 5.6.

## [2.2.6]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed the TCD overwrite issue when submit transfer request in the callback if there is a active TCD in hardware.

## [2.2.5]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed violations of MISRA C-2012 rule 10.1, 10.4.

## [2.2.4]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fix the issue that EDMA_AbortTransfer not reset edma handle(tcdUsed,
    tail, header) and fix EDMA_InstallTCDMemory(handle->header = 1)

## [2.2.3]

- Improvements
  - Added feature FSL_FEATURE_EDMA_MODULE_CHANNEL_IRQ_ENTRY_SUPPORT_PARAMETER to support driver IRQ handler with parameters.
  - Added feature FSL_FEATURE_EDMA_HAS_COMMON_CLOCK_GATE to improve clock gate control in dma driver.

## [2.2.2]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed the issue of EDMA_SubmitTransfer return busy when calling EDMA_EnableChannelInterrupts before submit transfer.
  - Fixed violations of MISRA C-2012 rule 10.4, 10.1, 9.2, 10.4, 10.6, 14.4, 10.7, 14.3, 11.6.

## [2.2.1]

- Improvements
  - Removed channel MUX reset from EDMA_ResetChannel, since channel mux should be constant while channel is alive.

## [2.2.0]

- Improvements
  - Added new API EDMA_SetChannelMux to support channel mux feature.
  - Added new API EDMA_PrepareTransferConfig to expose paramters source offset and destination offset.
  - Exposed EDMA_InstallTCD function to application.
  - Added source/destination address alignment check.

## [2.1.1]

- Improvements
  - Added 8bytes transfer width feature support in driver.

## [2.1.0]

- Bug Fixes
  - Added const type for parameter configuration in EDMA_SubmitTransfer and EDMA_HandleTransferConfig API.
  - Added configurations for srcAddr and destAddr in EDMA_PrepareTransfer API.

## [2.0.2]

- Improvements
  - Updated eDMA driver to support MP_CR bit GMRC.
  - Updated eDMA instance name for i.MX 8QM.
  - Used instance number as factor to calculate channel number for different instance instead of hard code.

## [2.0.1]

- New Features
  - Added control macro to enable/disable the CLOCK code in current driver.
  - Added s_EDMAEnabledChannel to record enabled channel to merge all the channel
    IRQ handler into driver IRQ handler.
  - Added feature macro for bits EMI and EBW in MP_CSR.
- Improvements
  - Removed all the separated channel IRQ handler in DMA driver.

## [2.0.0]

- Initial version.
