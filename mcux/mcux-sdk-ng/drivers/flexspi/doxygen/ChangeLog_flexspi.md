    kFLEXSPI_IpCommandExcutionDoneFlag to kFLEXSPI_IpCommandExecutionDoneFlag.
  - Fixed comments typos such as sequencen->sequence, levle->level.
  - Fixed FLSHCR2[ARDSEQID] field clean issue.

## [2.1.1]

- Improvements
  - Defaulted enable prefetch for AHB RX buffer configuration in FLEXSPI_GetDefaultConfig, which is align with the
    reset value in AHBRXBUFxCR0.
  - Added software workaround for ERR011377 in FLEXSPI_SetFlashConfig; added some delay after DLL lock status set
    to ensure correct data read/write.

## [2.1.0]

- New Features
  - Added new API FLEXSPI_UpdateRxSampleClock for users to update read sample clock source after initialization.
  - Added reset peripheral operation in FLEXSPI_Init if required.

## [2.0.5]

## [2.0.4]

- Bug Fixes
  - Reset flash size to zero for all ports in FLEXSPI_Init; fixed the possible out-of-range flash access with no
    error reported.

## [2.0.3]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed AHB receive buffer size configuration issue. The FLEXSPI_AHBRXBUFCR0_BUFSZ field should configure 64 bits
    size, and currently the AHB receive buffer size is in bytes which means 8-bit, so the correct configuration
    should be config->ahbConfig.buffer[i].bufferSize / 8.

## [2.0.2]

- New Features
  - Supported DQS write mask enable/disable feature during set FLEXSPI configuration.
  - Provided new API FLEXSPI_TransferUpdateSizeEDMA for users to update eDMA transfer size(SSIZE/DSIZE) per DMA
    transfer.
- Bug Fixes

  - Fixed incorrect operation of FLEXSPI_Init to configure IP TX FIFO watermark.

## [2.0.1]

- Bug Fixes
  - Fixed the flag clear issue and AHB read Command index configuration issue in FLEXSPI_SetFlashConfig.
  - Updated FLEXSPI_UpdateLUT function to update LUT table from any index instead of previous command index.
  - Added bus idle wait in FLEXSPI_SetFlashConfig and FLEXSPI_UpdateLUT to ensure bus is idle before any
    change to FlexSPI controller.
  - Updated interrupt API FLEXSPI_TransferNonBlocking and interrupt handle flow FLEXSPI_TransferHandleIRQ.
  - Updated eDMA API FLEXSPI_TransferEDMA.

## [2.0.0]

- Initial version.
