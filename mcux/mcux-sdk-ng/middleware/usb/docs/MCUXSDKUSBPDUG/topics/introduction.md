# Introduction

Many devices obtain their power from USB ports connected in laptops, cars, or wall sockets. Because of this, users need USB to fill their requirements not only in terms of data, but also to provide power or charge their devices.

The USB Power Delivery \(PD\) Specification enables maximum functionality over a single cable. Some specification features include an increased power level from existing USB standards, having power direction no longer fixed, optimized power management across multiple peripherals, intelligent and flexible system level management of power, and the allowed ability of low power cases.

This document includes step-by-step instructions to run the MCUXpresso USB Type-C Power Delivery stack.
