The TWR-K22F120M Tower System module or FRDM-K64F Freedom platform is used as an example in this document. The process for compiling, downloading, and running examples is similar on all other boards. For a detailed version of the toolchain software, see the *MCUXpresso SDK Release Notes* \(document MCUXSDKRN\).
