# Note

1.  The above steps provide the method based on the `dev_hid_mouse_bm` example to enable the `dev_msc_disk_bm` example on the M4 core of RT1170 or on the M7 core of RT1180. For other examples of RT1170, similar way applies to change an M7 project to an M4 project. For other examples of RT1180, similar way applies to change an M33 project to an M7 project.
2.  To enable FreeRTOS examples, refer to *dev\_hid\_mouse\_freertos*.
3.  To enable USB host examples, refer to *host\_hid\_mouse\_bm* or *host\_hid\_mouse\_freertos*.
