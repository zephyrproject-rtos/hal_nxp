Status:
   Some older Kinetis W family SoCs are not supported in MCUXpresso SDK, but
   instead are supported by the Kinetis Connectivity Software. This
   distribution is based on the same Kinetis SDK (ksdk) that MCUXpresso SDK
   evolved from. These older SoCs have many of the same peripherals as KW41Z,
   so we can reuse newer MCUXpresso SDK drivers from KW41Z, and import only the
   SoC header files from the Kinetis Connectivity Software.

   SoC		Version (Release Date)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   MCR20A	1.0.0
   MKW20Z4	1.0.1 (2015-12-10)
   MKW30Z4	1.0.1 (2015-12-10)
   MKW40Z4	1.0.1 (2015-12-10)

Purpose:
   Provides device header files and bare metal peripheral drivers for Kinetis,
   LPC, and i.MX SoCs. Zephyr shim drivers are built on top of these imported
   drivers to adapt the MCUXpresso SDK APIs to Zephyr APIs.

Description:
    This package is cloned from the Github for mcux-sdk. The cloned package is then copied and committ'ed
    into NXP's Zephyr HAL. Care should be taken to retain local changes to the SDK files that are documented
    in Patch List section of the document.

Dependencies:
   CMSIS header files

Patch List:
  1. Delete the .a binary archive files after an SDK update before committing the changes. These files are still present in the SDK github repo but have been
     deleted from the Zephyr HAL
  2. Move used job descriptors in the CAAM driver (mcux-sdk/drivers/caam/fsl_caam.c) from the stack to noncacheable section. At time of writing, there should
     be four being used for entropy in zephyr.
  3. Fixed flexcan_fd_frame being written into/written from the message buffer in the flexcan driver (mcux/mcux-sdk/drivers/flexcan/fsl_flexcan.c). On the
     write side, the EDL bit is now utilized for selection of can frame type and on the receiver side, the EDL and BRS status are read from the message
     buffer.
  4. Add device_system cmake definitions for the following SOCs: MKL25Z4, MK82F25615, MKW24D5, MKW40Z4, MKW41Z4
