Status:
   Some older Kinetis W family SoCs are not supported in MCUXpresso SDK, but
   instead are supported by the Kinetis Connectivity Software. This
   distribution is based on the same Kinetis SDK (ksdk) that MCUXpresso SDK
   evolved from. These older SoCs have many of the same peripherals as KW41Z,
   so we can reuse newer MCUXpresso SDK drivers from KW41Z, and import only the
   SoC header files from the Kinetis Connectivity Software.

   SoC		Version (Release Date)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   MCR20A	1.0.0
   MKW20Z4	1.0.1 (2015-12-10)
   MKW30Z4	1.0.1 (2015-12-10)
   MKW40Z4	1.0.1 (2015-12-10)

Purpose:
   Provides device header files and bare metal peripheral drivers for Kinetis,
   LPC, and i.MX SoCs. Zephyr shim drivers are built on top of these imported
   drivers to adapt the MCUXpresso SDK APIs to Zephyr APIs.

Description:
    This package is cloned from the Github for mcux-sdk. The cloned package is then copied and committ'ed
    into NXP's Zephyr HAL. Care should be taken to retain local changes to the SDK files that are documented
    in Patch List section of the document.

Dependencies:
   CMSIS header files

Patch List:
  1. mcux-sdk/drivers/caam/fsl_caam.c: Move used job descriptors in the CAAM driver from the stack to noncacheable section. At time of writing, there should
     be four being used for entropy in zephyr.
  2. Patched middleware_usb_common_header.cmake file to address build issue. PR submitted to upstream
  3. exclude the following directories and files from mcux-sdk update to reduce HAL size:
     - All *.a binary archive files. Files are still present in the SDK github repo but are not allowed in Zephyr Project
     - mcux-sdk\manifests
     - mcux-sdk\docs
  4. Add RW61X device_system.cmake
  5. devices: MCXN947: Update system file to remove SDK sepecific defines
  6. devices: MIMX8UD7: add header and source files for HIFI4 DSP core
  7. devices: MIMX8UD7: fsl_device_registers.h: add support for HIFI4 DSP
  8. devices: MIMX8UD7: add cmake file for reset driver
  9. drivers: lpflexcomm: lpi2c: Fixed an error in the driver when interacting with the lpflexcomm driver
