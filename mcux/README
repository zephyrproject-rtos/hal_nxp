   NXP MCUXpresso SDK Connectivity Framework
   https://github.com/nxp-mcuxpresso/mcux-sdk-middleware-connectivity-framework
   TAG: MCUX_2.15.000_RW610_RC1

Status:
   Some older Kinetis W family SoCs are not supported in MCUXpresso SDK, but
   instead are supported by the Kinetis Connectivity Software. This
   distribution is based on the same Kinetis SDK (ksdk) that MCUXpresso SDK
   evolved from. These older SoCs have many of the same peripherals as KW41Z,
   so we can reuse newer MCUXpresso SDK drivers from KW41Z, and import only the
   SoC header files from the Kinetis Connectivity Software.

   SoC		Version (Release Date)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   MCR20A	1.0.0
   MKW20Z4	1.0.1 (2015-12-10)
   MKW30Z4	1.0.1 (2015-12-10)
   MKW40Z4	1.0.1 (2015-12-10)

Purpose:
   Provides device header files and bare metal peripheral drivers for Kinetis,
   LPC, and i.MX SoCs. Zephyr shim drivers are built on top of these imported
   drivers to adapt the MCUXpresso SDK APIs to Zephyr APIs.

Description:
    This package is cloned from the Github for mcux-sdk. The cloned package is then copied and committ'ed
    into NXP's Zephyr HAL. Care should be taken to retain local changes to the SDK files that are documented
    in Patch List section of the document.

Dependencies:
   CMSIS header files

Patch List:
  - mcux-sdk/drivers/caam/fsl_caam.c: Move used job descriptors in the CAAM driver from the stack to noncacheable section. At time of writing, there should
     be four being used for entropy in zephyr.
     
  - Patched middleware_usb_common_header.cmake file to address build issue. PR submitted to upstream
  
  - exclude the following directories and files from mcux-sdk update to reduce HAL size:
     - All *.a binary archive files. Files are still present in the SDK github repo but are not allowed in Zephyr Project
     - mcux-sdk\manifests
     - mcux-sdk\docs
     - devices\KW45*
     - devices\K32W*
     - devices\MIMX9301 through MIMX9351
     - devices\MIMX9596

  - Add usb_device_mcux_drv_port.h file for using MCUX SDK USB device controller driver easily in Zephyr.
      - usb_device_mcux_drv_port.h contains the simplified structs, enums and APIs that MCUX SDK USB device controller drivers need.
      - Update usb_device_ehci.c and usb_device_lpcip3511.c if in Zephyr environment.
        - Add include of usb_device_mcux_drv_port.h.
        - Remove include of usb_device.h and usb_device_dci.h.

  - mcux-sdk-middleware-connectivity-framework: Add new CMake file connectivity_framework.cmake
  - mcux-sdk-middleware-connectivity-framework: rw61x: Fix assertion OSA Mutex Alloc fail
  - mcux-sdk-middleware-connectivity-framework: rw61x: Remove static from hci_cal_data buffers to be used inside Zephyr
