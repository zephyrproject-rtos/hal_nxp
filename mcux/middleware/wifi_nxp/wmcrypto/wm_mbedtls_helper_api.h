 * Set the maximum content length for each of the two internal I/O buffers

 * All values between 1 and 16384 (inclusive) are allowed.
 *
 * @note This function should be called after \ref wm_mbedtls_ssl_config_new
 * and before \ref wm_mbedtls_ssl_new.
 *
 * @note The RFC defines the default size of SSL / TLS messages.
 * If you change the value here, other clients / servers may not be able to
 * communicate with you anymore. Only change this value if you control
 * both sides of the connection and have it reduced at both sides, or
 * if you're using the Max Fragment Length (MBEDTLS_SSL_MAX_FRAGMENT_LENGTH)
 * extension and you know all your peers are using it too! (Ref: mbedtls/ssl.h)
 *
 * @note Setting MBEDTLS_SSL_MAX_CONTENT_LEN provides a compile-time mechanism
 * to set the same maximum content length for all SSL / TLS sessions in all
 * (in+out) directions. Additionally, WMSDKA has a run-time mechanism
 * (\ref wm_mbedtls_ssl_conf_buffsizes()) to set maximum content length for a
 * particular ssl session in a particular direction (in and/or out).
 * Applications can use a combination of both mechanism to communicate
 * with other ends of connection successfully and still be able to reduce
 * memory footprint. WMSDKA has set a smaller default value of
 * MBEDTLS_SSL_MAX_CONTENT_LEN to cater to most common use-cases
 * (Ref: config/default.h), while using \ref wm_mbedtls_ssl_conf_buffsizes()
 * in cases where transfer sizes can be larger, e.g. over-the-air upgrade of
 * large firmware upgrade files over SSL / TLS.
 *
 * @note If Max Fragment Length (MBEDTLS_SSL_MAX_FRAGMENT_LENGTH) extension is
 * enabled, effective buffer length is rounded down to one of 512, 1024, 2048,
 * 4096 or 16384 internally to avoid failures. It also supports values < 512
 * bytes, in which case effective buffer length is set to actual value,
 * disabling exchange of Max Fragment Length extension during handshake. This
 * allows for maximum flexiblity by allowing all values between 1 to 16384.
 * Applications can override the default behavior by calling
 * mbedtls_ssl_conf_max_frag_len(conf, MBEDTLS_SSL_MAX_FRAG_LEN_NONE)
 * after calling wm_mbedtls_ssl_conf_buffsizes(conf, in_buf_len, out_buf_len)
 * in which case effective buffer length will be set exactly to
 * (in_buf_len, out_buf_len), disabling the exchange
 * of Max Fragment Length extension during handshake.
