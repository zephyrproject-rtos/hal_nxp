 * before starting micro-AP.

 * entry as NULL. The dns server handles dns queries and if domain name match is
 * found then resolves it to device ip address. Currently the maximum length for
 * each domain name is set to 32 bytes.

 * char *domain_names[] = {"nxpprov.net", "www.nxpprov.net", NULL};
 *
 * dhcp_enable_dns_server(domain_names);
 *
 * However, application can also start dns server without any domain names
 * specified to solve following issue.
 * Some of the client devices do not show WiFi signal strength symbol when
 * connected to micro-AP in open mode, if dns queries are not resolved.
 * With dns server support enabled, dns server responds with ERROR_REFUSED
 * indicating that the DNS server refuses to provide whatever data client is
 * asking for.
