* \section intro Introduction
*
* NXP wireless SoCs require a combination of firmware binary image 
* streamed into the radio subsystem, and driver source code compiled
* onto the application MCU. The radio driver source code
* provides APIs that enable a developer to send and receive packets over
* the radio interfaces by communicating with the firmware images that 
* are streamed into the radio subsystems on start-up.
*
* \subsection devdoc Developer Documentation
*
* This manual provides developer reference documentation for Wi-Fi driver and
* Wi-Fi Connection Manager.
* Refer to the source code for additional information.
*
* \note
* The File Documentation provides documentation for all the APIs that are
* available in Wi-Fi driver and connection manager.\n
