/*
 * This file collects all dependencies of mcuxClBuffer functionality
 * to other components and checks the platform's feature flags config
 * for consistency in the mcuxClBuffer domain.
 * Public feature flags are translated into internal mcuxClBuffer features
 * which are used for guarding functions. This is needed to avoid the
 * inclusion of Buffer object fields and functions, which are not used
 * at all in the current platform's feature scope, in the build.
 * The aim of these internally defined feature flags is to have
 * sounding names for inclusion guards, and to have a single
 * point of translation from public features to all internal
 * usages.
